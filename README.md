# FaceNet-and-MTCNN-
How to Develop a Face Recognition System Using FaceNet in Keras in Deep Learning for Computer Vision. Face recognition is a computer vision task of identifying and verifying a person based on a photograph of their face.  FaceNet is a face recognition system developed in 2015 by researchers at Google that achieved then state-of-the-art results on a range of face recognition benchmark datasets. The FaceNet system can be used broadly thanks to multiple third-party open source implementations of the model and the availability of pre-trained models.
